# Portland homeless sleeping location map

#### Problem Statement - What is the problem you are attempting to address with your map?

I’m trying to address the contentious issue of homelessness in Portland. There is a lot of debate and emotions about the homeless but the issue is plagued by misinformation. I’d like to interpret the facts of the issue in a way that can constructively contribute the discussion.

#### What story to tell - What story will you tell with your map and data to highlight unique angle of your problem?

My map will show homeless sleeping locations on a map of Portland with over the course of a number of years that the data was collected. It will also include general descriptions of the different areas and other relevant info when each area is clicked on.

#### Data needs - What data will you use? how will you access the data? does it need to be cleaned/processed before putting on a map?

I will use data from the Portland homelessness survey that has been collected into the Civic API built by Hack Oregon. Some of the data will probably need to be processed, but some of that work has already been done by the Hack Oregon Homelessness team. I will work with my contacts on the team to collect any data or content I’ll need for the project.
